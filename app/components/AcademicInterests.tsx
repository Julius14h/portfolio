              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 text-sm mb-3">
                My forensic science studies have deepened my interest in the ethical and societal implications of emerging technologies. I am particularly focused on understanding the empirical evidence supporting or questioning these tools and their historical context. This drives my passion for research and my interest in the growing integration of AI in education. I&apos;m also fascinated by artificial intelligence and machine learning, especially their applications in healthcare and biological research.
